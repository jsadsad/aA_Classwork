# Vanilla

Vanilla is a term used to describe standard JavaScript without the use of additional frameworks or libraries. For example, the use of jQuery to make .ajax requests means that one is not using vanilla JavaScript.

# jQuery
jQuery is a free, open-source JavaScript library that allows its users to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model). It was originally released in 2006, and it is now the most widely used JavaScript library on the Internet, being installed on 65% of the ten million most-trafficked websites. jQuery includes both a variety of functions that can be called on jQuery objects and utility functions such as $.ajax(). jQuery allows coders a slightly easier way, compared to vanilla JavaScript, to do almost everything - it's almost like coding in Ruby.

jQuery's utility functions roughly mirror those provided by lodash.js.

jQuery is widely used for making AJAX requests, handling events, manipulating the DOM, and guaranteeing it works across browsers.

`$l` = jQuery lite. The $ represents the jquery function and the l stands for lite.

# POJO
A POJO, or Plain Old JavaScript Object, is an object with attributes, getter methods, and setter methods. Since JavaScript objects allow access to their attributes via dot (obj.attr) and / or bracket (obj["attr"]) notation, any JavaScript object without additional methods is a POJO.

The term comes from Java, with the "J" in the acronym originally having stood for "Java."
