// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.

// All required JavaScript files are listed in the comment block at the top.This works in a similar fashion to placing < script > tags in our HTML, except that Rails compiles them all into a single file for production.

// serializejson is for submitting forms
// require_tree is to access all the js files from this folder

//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require jquery.serializejson
//= require_tree .
