# React

The beauty of _React_ is changing one small part at a time - the scope of the information.

Using React is making your own HTML element. With React, you can give it any behavior you want.

# Life Cycle

When the component is not needed anymore, we want to stop the process.

When a component's state is updated, it gets rerendered.

The child of an updated component will rerender. The Parent of the child will not.

`componentDidMount() {}` will be _after_ the first render.

`addEventListener` adds an event on the page(hook). A function that will run when a certain event happens.

`e.stopPropagation()` prevents the click event on the parent from triggering.

You can pass function as a prop.
